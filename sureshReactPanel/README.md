# DTI

## Install the dependencies

First of all make sure you have  

```bash
Node,
Vs Code,
Power shell / cmd / git bash 
```
### Requirements

Please make sure you use the node’s LTS version which is recommended by the official node site and not the one with the latest features or previous versions. Our project is not tested to work with other Node versions.

### Important!

Before installing the node_modules, make sure you have files starting with a dot(.eslintrc, .env etc..). It mostly happens when hidden files are not enabled on your machine and you try to copy our template at some other place on your system.

### Instructions

After downloading zip, copy this zip to your desired location and then unzip it. Do not unzip first and then copy files to another location, it may not be able to run the template due to missing hidden files not copied over.

In uncompressed folder you will find ts-version / js-version folders which contains full-version & starter-kit folders. Unzip the one you want to get started with and open this folder in your console/terminal.

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
